# Uber-Clone.
This is a full-stack ride-sharing application modeled after Uber, featuring real-time location tracking, ride booking, and dynamic driver-passenger matching. The platform enables users to request rides and captains (drivers) to accept and complete them, with live Socket.IO-based communication and interactive map integration.
